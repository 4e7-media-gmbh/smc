# ABOUT

In spring 2010 Alex Sch√∂nburg, Max Scheichenost and Christoph Jeschke started the Social Media Club Austria.

 


Inspired by the founder of Social Media Club Chris Heuer and Kristie Wells, they launched the platform to connect media makers to promote media literacy, promote standard technologies, encourage ethical behavior and share best practices.

 
 

SMCA has become one of the leading Social Media Blogs in Austria, inviting everybody interested in creativity, communication and advertising to participate. Guest authors publish regularly and enrich the community of SMCA with interdisciplinary content.
